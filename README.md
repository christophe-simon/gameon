## About The Project

[![GameOn screenshot][product-screenshot]](#)

GameOn is a fictive company specialized in gaming conferences and competitions.

This project is their website, proposing an online form in order to subscribe to an event, made as a student homework.

The work was first started by a fictive colleague from [these mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/B7NKBDvSI18uoMLJgpnh48/UI-Design-GameOn-FR?node-id=106%3A630). This fictive colleague started working on the HTML structure and the CSS style, based on these mockups. He finished the layout and the content of the homepage and the form modal. He also started the JavaScript developpement. His repo is available [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR/).

I completed this fictive colleague's work by correcting some bugs on the registration form and finishing the required JavaScript developpement.

The requirements were:

- use separate files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript;
- always comment your code (describe each function and class, as well as the parts of the code that need more details);
- manually test functionality, form inputs and responsive display.
